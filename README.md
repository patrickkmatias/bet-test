#### Admissional test for "RealsBet" company

## 🚀 Run the project

- Needed dependencies: [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x) (along with PHP and Composer). Linux is recommended.

1. After cloning the project, you should start PostgreSQL database to fill it with test data:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```
2. Then, you can run the following command to install all dependencies and prepare all the environment of a newly cloned repository:
```sh
npm run init
```
3. If the seeding was successful, you will be able to access the system with these default credentials:
```
Email: test@example.com
Password: password
```
- The project is covered by tests; they can be executed using `php artisan test`

## 👨🏾‍💻 Comments

I didn't have spare time to even start the project, so all what I could develop is from about 12h~24h from now. Hope you enjoy it =)
